/**
@page session Session

A session is a state in which the user is in control of the system using hand points.
While in session, hand points are tracked and have persistent IDs.

There are 3 possible states:
- Not in session: Looking for a gesture
- In session: Tracking hand points
- Quick refocus (optional): Looking for the gesture and an additional quick refocus gesture.

The session is encapsulated in the @ref XnVSessionManager object.
Each hand point is represented by the @ref XnVHandPointContext structure.
*/

/**
@page controls NITE Controls

There are many objects that get the hand points (see @ref XnVHandPointContext), and perform some action.
This action is to understand the stream of points as a coherent movement.
These objects are all subclasses of @ref XnVMessageListener.
Objects that send hand points (or, indeed, any other data) are subclasses of @ref XnVMessageGenerator.
There are controls that both receive data and send data, either filtering the data or altering it.
Those are subclasses of either @ref XnVFilter or @ref XnVPointFilter, themselves subclasses of both Generator and Listener.
